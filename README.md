# Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

This project is part of the Udacity AI Programming with Python course, aiming to develop a pre-trained image classifier to identify dog breeds. The primary objectives of the project are:

* Identify Dogs: Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs, even if the breed is misclassified.
Distinguish between pet images that are and aren't of dogs.

* Classify Dog Breeds: Correctly classify the breed of dogs in the images that are identified as dogs.
  
* Evaluate CNN Model Architectures: Determine the most effective CNN model architecture among ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG to achieve objectives 1 and 2.

* Optimization and Resource Consideration: Consider the time resources required to achieve the objectives. Assess whether alternative solutions could provide a "good enough" result within reasonable time constraints.
